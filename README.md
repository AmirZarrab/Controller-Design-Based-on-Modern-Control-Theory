## Project Objectives
- **System Stability Analysis**: Determining poles, zeros, and phase characteristics for stability in open-loop systems.
- **Controllability and Observability**: Validating the system's controllability and observability, ensuring it meets the requirements for state feedback and observer design.
- **State Feedback Control Design**: Implementing state feedback controllers with specified pole placements to manage system response, including factors like overshoot, rise time, and steady-state error.
- **Observer Design**: Designing static and integral observers for state estimation, analyzing their robustness against model variations and disturbances.
- **LQR Optimization**: Using Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) for optimal control, with experiments on Q and R matrix variations to examine performance impacts.

## Key Features
- **MATLAB & Simulink Simulations**: MATLABâ€™s Control System Toolbox is used for all model-based design and simulations, and Simulink models visually represent the feedback and observer responses.
- **Step-by-Step Calculation and Explanation**: The repository contains all necessary calculations, MATLAB commands, and Simulink models to replicate and understand the design process.
- **Question and Answer Document**: A document with all project questions is included, allowing easy reference to the project's requirements.
